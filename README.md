# NARU
WIP game for TI-84+ calculators. Written in Axe.

# About
This game does not have an objective yet and you can't do much more than move around the screen and interact with objects. So, it's not really "playable". The byte limit ran out so I do not know if this game will ever be complete, yet I make a repository anyway because it can serve as a base from which other games can be made, it took me a long time to make and I don't want to lose the code, and I'm proud of it, however simple and clunky it may be. 

# Controls
Arrow keys to move. "Mode" to view inventory. "Enter" to exit menus and to unequip shovel. "1" to use/place/equip item in slot one of inventory, "2" for slot 2.
"2nd" to pick up items. "Clear" to exit the game.

# Art
All sprites and pixel art for this game were made entirely by me.

# Code 
All code for this game written by me. It's probably not the best code in terms of optimization and good programming practices, though.

# Copyright
Feel free to use this game as a base for your own games, but don't steal or claim your own my sprites and artwork, the name NARU for the main character, or "borrowing" the majority of my code line by line without permission. Also, don't make money off of my game, my code, or my art, which means don't sell any of it. Not that it's good enough for that, it's just I don't want my stuff stolen.
Also thanks to the creator of Axe Parser for the awesome language.
