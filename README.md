# NARU
WIP game for TI-84+ calculators. Written in Axe.

# About
This game does not have an objective yet and you can't do much more than move around the screen and interact with objects. So, it's not really "playable". The byte limit ran out so I do not know if this game will ever be complete, yet I make a repository anyway because it can serve as a base from which other games can be made, it took me a long time to make and I don't want to lose the code, and I'm proud of it, however simple and clunky it may be. 

# Controls
Arrow keys to move. "Mode" to view inventory. "Enter" to exit menus and to unequip shovel. "1" to use/place/equip item in slot one of inventory, "2" for slot 2.
"2nd" to pick up items. "Clear" to exit the game.

# Art
All sprites and pixel art for this game were made entirely by me.

# Code 
All code for this game written by me. It's probably not the best code in terms of optimization and good programming practices, though.
